 ### App Overview

### App Uses   
- The app can be used as a tool for touring unknown historic points of a particular dataset when connected to the city, for initial desk research purposes, or workshop facilitation.  

### Audience Interaction

<summary> Project Learning Outcomes üìú </summary>

-  How to design for a mobile-first experience including a navigation for user interface composed for mobile dexterity.

- How to design for user testing and feedback capture.  The focus group gave some interesting insights related to icons, colour, walk through of the broader idea which were incorporated in the processes or the app itself.

- The incorporated use of the phycology of colour when presenting difficult information, here the strategy was to subvert the nature of the difficult information being presented, with colours which were essentially opposite to the given presentation of data.

- The design patterns: how to think systematically about archival data, how to sort it and extract the core story. 

- Participant Gallery feature could potentially become a spin-off app in its own right, to include audio and video of the guided learning.
