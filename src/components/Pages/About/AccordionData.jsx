    In 1835, the British government passed the Slavery Abolition Act which abolished the transatlantic slave trade and granted freedom to enslaved people in British colonies. To compensate slave owners who lost their "property" as a result of this act, the government established a compensation scheme and paid out Â£20 million in bonds over 38 years. This compensation was controversial as it rewarded slave owners for the exploitation and oppression of enslaved people, critics argued that the money should have been used to aid the newly freed slaves.
    in order to pay the correct compensation, a detailed survey had to be carried out of the 'property' the legacy of the survey are the names, addresses and plantation details of former slave owners.
